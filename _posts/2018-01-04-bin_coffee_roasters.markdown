As soon as I clicked on the button to go to the CLI Data Gem Project page, I got nervous! It seemed like a huge project to work on, on my own from start to finish without much help like labs and “Ask a Question”. I calmed myself down by saying to myself “I’m going to go slow, step by step, little chunks of code at a time and build from there.”

As I sipped my morning coffee, I pondered what website to scrape. For this project, I wanted to do something related to animals or pets but someone had already done Pet Finder and I didn’t feel like doing it without cute pictures of pets. Then I just kind of looked at cafes as I’m always looking for new cafes to try out. While I was searching for coffee related websites, I found Thrillist’s "the best 21 coffee roasters". This website piqued my interest . I’ve passed by a cafe called “Blue Bottle” many times and it seemed really popular. According to Thrillist, they are one of the best coffee roasters in the U.S. Anyway, that morning I joined the study group thinking I’m just going to watch Corinna explain about CLI gems but she personally asked me if I had any websites in mind. I wasn’t set on coffees but I asked if the Thrillist site would be a good one to scrape and got a thumbs up! 

Once I checked out Avi’s CLI Gem Walkthrough video, it didn’t seem that difficult… Avi makes it look so easy! I started coding along with the video and started building my CLI gem. I got a little confused as to how to set up the files, where to put gem requirements, etc. Do I make an environment file to load all dependencies although Bundle didn’t set up a file called environment.rb? Well, Bundler sets up everything for you but it’s not called environment. It gives you a console file and from there, it requires a file named after your project in the lib folder where you can load all your dependencies. Now everything was making sense.

Scraping part was actually fun for me (thank god it was a simple website) using PRY a lot. I wasn’t really sure how to use PRY up to this point but thanks to study groups, I learned where to put it and got comfortable with it. It really helped me understand what is going on with my code. Now I love using it!

All in all, it took longer than I thought with holidays get togethers and my job but I’m happy that my cli gem is working and also I was able to publish my first gem on Rubygems.org.
