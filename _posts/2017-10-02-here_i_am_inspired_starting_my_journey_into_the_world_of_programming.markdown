Ever since I was a little girl, I loved creating things and was always interested in technology. I studied art, started my career in graphic design and then into motion design. As I used software to create, I was fascinated with what it can do and admired programmers. 

For several years, I enjoyed creating as a motion designer. Then I worked with this person who could design and program. He taught me how to write scripts and made my life easier to animate. It was automagical! As I worked with him on different projects, I saw him write codes so fluently and create beautiful things. It was like magic!

And so here I am, inspired, starting my journey into the world of programming. Iâ€™m hoping that I would be able to see my imagination come to life, help to improve people's life and make the world a better place.
